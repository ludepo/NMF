The repo contains the data necessary to run part 1), 2) and 3).

currently I am facing two problems: 
1. I am from a logical standpoint on my work not sure, whether I should filter for the L&M finterms (as stop words) or not. How would you say changes the quality of the model if I include or exclude the dictionary?
2. I was not able to check for the optimal amount of clusters as the options I tried took too long to run. Do you have any idea?

As I told you I have not had any expericence in coding before this project so I would be more than happy if you could let me know if there are some fundamental mistakes.
